              <p>
                This phase involves gathering and analyzing the requirements for the software. This includes understanding the purpose, scope, and goals of the software, identifying user needs, and defining the features and functionality required.

              <p>
                In this phase, the software design is created based on the requirements gathered during the planning phase. This includes creating a detailed architecture of the system, designing the user interface, and defining the data flow and algorithms.

              <p>
                This is the phase where the actual coding and development of the software takes place. The software development team uses the design as a blueprint to develop the software and write the code.

              <p>
                Once the software has been developed, it is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and is functioning correctly. Testing can include functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing.

              <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Deployment and maintenance</h3>
              <p>
                Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. The deployment process involves installing the software on the relevant hardware and configuring it to work with the existing systems. After deployment, the software is monitored and maintained to ensure that it continues to function correctly and meet the needs of the users.
